//! Well, it is kind of tradeoff. Either I pull C++0x requirement(not so much deal, as development will take a while)
//! and eliminate code duplicate, but without using std::algorithm. Or I could split it for different count of args, 
//!	use boost::lambda, get code duplicate and stay in C++03. 
//!	Well, when C++0x lambdas will work with vardaic args, it will be even more elegant.
